# Plant Pal

## About
Plant Pal is an application that allows a user to keep track of all of their house plants and their requirements in one convenient place. A user can create a new plant by adding the type of plant, an optional nickname, how much sun and water is required, and a picture of the plant. A user can add notes and categories to each plant, allowing them to find their plants more easily and keep track of all of their needs. Plants can be edited or deleted, allowing the user to keep track of everything easily and seamlessly.

<!-- Plant Pal is hosted on Heroku at: Coming Soon -->

<!-- The GitHub Repository of a front-end application built using this API can be found here: Coming Soon -->

## How to Use Plant Pal
This application does not have a landing page, and so the first thing you will see is a 404 error. This is expected. As there is no front end to this project, all navigation must be done via the address bar.
